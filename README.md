# Real Estate Price Prediction
A data analysis project exploring real estate pricing factors using statistical tests, visualizations, and a linear regression model. The project cleans the dataset, identifies correlations, detects outliers, and builds a predictive model to understand how features like proximity to MRT stations, number of convenience stores, and house age influence housing prices.
